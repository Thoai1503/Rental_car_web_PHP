# Rental Car Web PHP

A web application for renting cars, built with PHP and HTML. This project provides an interactive platform for customers to browse, book, and review rental cars, and for administrators to manage bookings, cars, and users.

## Features

### For Customers
- **Car Selection**: Browse available cars with detailed features (e.g., Air Conditioning, GPS, Bluetooth, Audio Input, Child Seat, Remote Central Locking, etc.).
- **Booking Process**: 
  1. Choose Time & Place
  2. Select Car
  3. Enter Details
  4. Checkout
  5. Done
- **Car Details Page**: View car features, photos, and customer reviews.
- **Interactive UI**: Carousel sliders, sticky headers, date pickers, and smooth scrolling navigation.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices.

### For Admins
- **Booking Management**: View booking details, car info, and user details.
- **User Management**: Manage customer and admin accounts.
- **Car Management**: Add, edit, and remove cars from the system.
- **DataTables Integration**: Enhanced tables for viewing and managing data.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: PHP
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with jQuery, Owl Carousel, AOS, and DataTables)
- **Design**: Responsive design with Bootstrap-style components
- **No database details provided** (but typical usage would include MySQL or similar)

## Project Structure

- `views/client/` - Customer-facing pages (about, car details, index, services, etc.)
- `views/admin/` - Admin functionalities (booking details, etc.)
- `public/client/js/` - Main JavaScript logic for UI interactivity
- `public/client/css/` - Stylesheets for the client UI

## How It Works

1. **Time & Place**: User selects rental dates and pickup location.
2. **Car**: User browses and selects a car from available options.
3. **Details**: User provides personal and payment information.
4. **Checkout**: User reviews and confirms the booking.
5. **Done**: Booking is completed and confirmation is shown.
